The data were collected from 20 retired high-performance athletes (10 male and 10 female) representing six different countries (Japan, Mexico, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, and the UK). Thematic analysis was applied to the processing of the data and five themes emerged: (1) Funding battles: financial challenges and misjudgements; (2) Coping Strategies; (3) Support from sponsors, parents, and sport organisations; (4) Development of Financial Literacy; and (5) Life After Sport. The data indicates that athletes experienced financial challenges due to a lack of organisational support, reduced or terminated funding, and limited opportunities to access sponsorship. Typically, athletes developed their financial literacy and self-management skills by ‘self-help’ or ‘trial and error’. The findings contribute to both literature and practice by providing empirical evidence on the coping strategies adopted by athletes in order to overcome financial challenges and on the methods used in order to develop their financial literacy and self-management skills. These findings inform sport organisations and governing bodies to develop support schemes for high-performance athletes as well as deepen our knowledge of athletes’ career development and transitions focusing on the financial aspect.",7/1/21,9/29/25 19:27,,7,14,,,,,,,career development and management; career transitions in sport; financial literacy and self-management; financial well-being; organisational support

Although the research literature and professional body of knowledge of critical information literacy (CIL), is one of the most theoretically-developed areas of wider critical librarianship (Critlib) movement, working-class knowledge and experiences remain underrepresented. One reason for this is that the values, behaviour and assumptions of library and HE workers are shaped by a HE system which inculcates middle-class values and cultural capitals within students, and stigmatises working-class students as lacking or in deficit. Hegemonic, or noncritical, IL proselytises middle-class values and assumptions about academic practices and skills development including the notion of an ideal student with behaviour and markers of identity which reflect those most privileged by wider society.

(2) How do digital football simulations (games) disrupt or reproduce racialised stereotypes and logics found within football in the social world? (3) How does playing football video games contribute to users' understandings of race and sport. This paper, the first in-depth study of its kind, provides new empirical insights into the presence of the 'natural athlete' discourse within the operative datasets that underpin White and Black digital player performances in FIFA 20. We conclude that FIFA 20 is a site for a potent experiential socialisation in racialised myths, where gamers come to know race and the racialized other in sport through feeling the racialized differences of the procedurally generated natural athlete quite literally through their controllers.

The definition was derived from a review of the systems thinking literature combined with the application of systems thinking to itself. Many different definitions of systems thinking can be found throughout the systems community, but key components of a singular definition can be distilled from the literature. This researcher considered these components both individually and holistically, then proposed a new definition of systems thinking that integrates these components as a system. The definition was tested for fidelity against a System Test and against three widely accepted system archetypes. Systems thinking is widely believed to be critical in handling the complexity facing the world in the coming decades; however, it still resides in the educational margins. In order for this important skill to receive mainstream educational attention, a complete definition is required. Such a definition has not yet been established. This research is an attempt to rectify this deficiency by providing such a definition.",2015,9/29/25 19:28,669-678,,44,,,,,,,System dynamics; Systems approach; Systems thinking; Systems thinking definition; What is systems thinking

In 2019, Australian WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) player Liz Cambage, who self-identifies as biracial, revealed her experiences with depression, anxiety, substance abuse and panic attacks that have interrupted her professional career multiple times. For communication studies scholars, Cambage's discourse, we must examine it because Black women are frequently encouraged to compartmentalize their emotions and mental health stressors instead of expressing them. It is critical to examine this discourse for WNBA players who spend most of their time away from home as they participate in multiple professional leagues every year. Using Critical Race Theory, specifically the concept of a counter story, this essay argues that Cambage's mediated mental health disclosures function as resistance to stereotypes about Black women and mental health.",2022,9/29/25 19:28,,5,33,Howard Journal of Communications,,,,,,Anxiety; Attitudes toward mental illness; Black people; Experience; Implicit bias; Mental depression; Mental health; Offices of Mental Health Practitioners (except Physicians); Panic disorders; Psychological stress; Racism; Sports participation; Substance abuse

The purpose of this study is to enhance understandings about how community college presidents of African descent construct antiracism, how those definitions are communicated, and the rationale for creating opportunities to disrupt racism within predominantly White campus environments. Methods: Six presidents participated in three semi-structured interviews lasting approximately 75-minutes each. The sample included three men and three women. Interviews focused on institutional communications about racial tensions concerning how presidents' identities (e.g., race and gender) influenced decision making with campus stakeholders and presidential roles in defining and enacting antiracism. Results: Three themes emerged including how Accountability matters, the need for Space creators, and importance of developing Student ""critical"" mass. Participants discussed how they created spaces and utilized cultural capital networks to advance campus diversity agendas to benefit their institutions. Presidents posited that although community college leaders were likely motivated to participate in anti-racist practices due to the bettering of institutional image, decisive work needed to be done despite knowing endemic racism occurs in perpetuity. Conclusions/Contributions: This study highlights the need for enhanced training of presidents about how to conceptualize and engage campus racism. Additionally, presidents posited that the majority of students on their campuses were ready to engage in antiracism leadership activism, but they needed training to be empowered to develop anti-racist programs and practices. Finally, institutions need to develop stronger and more systematic ways to call out racism and promote anti-racist programing and practices.",2022,9/29/25 19:28,,4,50,Community College Review,,,,,,"Anti-racism; Coalitions; Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools; Community colleges; Historically Black colleges & universities; Institutional racism; Junior Colleges; Race relations; Student activism"

The protagonist in our story, Rachel Justice, rooted in fugitive pedagogy, is faced with the dilemma of participating in the implementation of this UNC DEI ban. We develop and apply a <italic>fugitive critical policy analysis</italic> to identify and present five interrelated dynamics enacted by the policy and lived by racially minoritized individuals: regressive legalism, institutional gaslighting; epistemic exile; contradictory advocacy; and narrative shelter-making. These dynamics illuminate the afterlives of anti-DEI policy in institutional structures and in the voices and imaginaries of those it seeks to silence. Through encounters with spirit guides embodying epistemic exile across institutional boundaries, we illuminate interpretive reimagination: a justice-driven alternative to regressive legalism that navigates legal ambiguity with radical creativity. In doing so, this paper refuses erasure, affirms memory, and demands more than survival in an era of white institutional reconstruction.",2025,9/29/25 19:28,,,,Journal of Higher Education,,,,,,Critical analysis; Critical pedagogy; Critical race theory; Diversity & inclusion policies; Higher education; Institutional environment; Policy analysis; Race relations; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

In this paper, I show that persons could develop and use racial categorizations in association with family relations to make salient (or not) the relevance of past racial injustice for contemporary concerns. I examined how people construct and orient to racial group membership as implying historical oppression, and its relevance for contemporary interracial relations in the form of supporting or opposing Critical Race Theory (CRT) teaching in the United States public school system. I examined debates and discussions on CRT televised in the American news media using discursive psychological approaches. Findings show that race categories were developed and used in relation to one's ancestors: parents, aunts and uncles, and distant generations. This was done to raise the salience of past racial injustice, which otherwise would involve offering historic or other social structural arguments. The use of family derived race categories at once personalized and enhanced the credibility of the speaker, and countered possible implications for taking responsibility for past actions. These family‐derived race categories were then a resource speakers could use to negotiate their position on CRT. These findings are discussed in relation to the relevance of time for negotiating racism. Further arguments are developed in relation to how an ethnomethodological approach can illuminate critical arguments on race and racism.",2024,9/29/25 19:28,,1,80,Journal of Social Issues,,,,,,Civil rights; Critical race theory; Discursive psychology; Families; Race; Racism; Social psychology; Television Broadcasting; Television broadcasting of news

Although extensive work has been done to review the retirement experiences of athletes, relatively less work has been done to examine and reflect on this expansive body of literature with a pragmatic aim of deciding what needs to happen to better support retiring athletes. This study used scoping review methodology to review current academic reviews, gray literature articles, and support programs on athletic retirement. This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute reviewer’s manual guide on scoping reviews and adhered to the PRISMA-ScR checklist. Academic articles were identified from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus. Gray literature articles and support programs were identified using advanced Google searches. This study identified 23 academic reviews, 44 gray literature articles, and 15 support programs. Generally, the results suggest that athletic retirement encompasses a drastic shift in identity, a loss of social networks, a lack of career ambitions, and potential risks to physical and mental health. While there was a gap in the academic literature regarding practical strategies to support retiring athletes, the gray literature suggests many creative ideas. Stepwise programming may be beneficial to help athletes: (a) make sense of their athletic experience and see retirement as an ongoing process; (b) develop a well-rounded sense of self identity and understand how to apply their unique skills and strengths in new ways; (3) gain control over their retirement transition by establishing a clear plan and adjusting to new routines and opportunities; and (4) normalize the transition experience by “living in the next” and building confidence in new life directions. Future research may benefit from developing and evaluating more programming to support athletes through the retirement transition.",9/21/23,9/29/25 19:27,14-Jan,9-Sep,18,,,,,,,

The aggregate impact of anti-Black racism, a specific form of racism, potentiates the marginalization of Black Americans. While Black intellectuals have a distinct role to play in dismantling systems of oppression, gatekeepers protect hegemonic systems that perpetuate the status quo and mute Black voices. Critical race theory (CRT) serves as a lens for confronting America's racist past and provides a mechanism for addressing systems that perpetuate inequities. CRT is a theoretical framework useful in designing approaches to dismantling structural racism and counterbalancing dominant paradigms, each foundational to developing a new social contract with Black Americans. This article presents a community building model to support the advancement of ethical public service in complex social environments.

The review addresses critical regulatory and ethical challenges, emphasizing the imperative for explainable AI (XAI) and robust governance frameworks to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI-driven systems. Despite rapid advancements, persistent gaps remain, the most notable of which is the lack of standardized frameworks for AI implementation across financial sectors.

Finally, AI can help behavioural scientists to “see the system,” by enabling the creation of more complex and dynamic models of consumer behaviour. While these opportunities will significantly advance behavioural science and offer great promise to improve consumer outcomes, we highlight several costs of using AI.

Therefore, the question arises how professional players' financial precaution within the social setting football is shaped. As no empirical analyses have yet been carried out on this issue, the study study examines football players' precautionary practices and motives.Design/methodology/approachSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 German (former) professional football players. The authors used qualitative content analysis to analyse the data, expanding the analysis to include reconstructive elements to create different precautionary types.FindingsThe results reveal that players deal with both career-specific as well as precaution-related risks quite heterogeneously. Accordingly, three precautionary types characterised by distinct forms of precautionary saving practices are identified. The authors also find that although the players are aware of the uncertainties and risks related to their professional football careers, it does not say much about the concrete implementation of adequate precautionary practices.Practical implicationsThe findings contribute to a better understanding of precautionary saving practices among football players.Social implicationsMoreover, the findings contribute to a better understanding of precautionary saving practices not only specifically among (former) football players, but generally among individuals that face high occupational career risks and earn high salaries to develop preventative concepts and approaches to sustainable financial planning.Originality/valueThis paper is the first empirical study that analyses precautionary savings practices of the specific population of elite athletes in high income sports professional football.",2023,9/29/25 19:27,354-375,3,13,,English,,Research Library,2793956705,<p>Copyright - © Emerald Publishing Limited.</p>; <p>Last updated - 2024-12-17</p>; <p>Name - Bundesliga</p>; <p>SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - Germany</p>,71121:Spectator Sports; Association football; Business And Economics--Management; Career risks; Decision making; Financial planning; Football; Football player; Germany; High income; Households; Income uncertainty; Influence; Player; Precautionary savings; Precautionary types; Professional football; Professional football players; Professionals; Qualitative study; Retirement planning; Standard of living; Wages & salaries

In other words, should Canadian legal scholars 'get real' about the intractability of race? Or can anti-Black racism be effectively confronted by developing legal and evidentiary tools designed to fix, rather than dismantle, the current system? Put another way, this article aims to move from describing a well-known phenomenon--the existence of anti-Black racism in the criminal justice system--to identifying radical approaches to confront and subvert it.

This essay argues that such legislation is best understood as the latest iteration of a long-standing reactionary political practice. This practice goes back a century to World War I and the 1920s. Then, as now, it was marked by two critical elements: an argument about national identity and a focus on public schools. In the early twentieth century, conservatives began systematically fusing ethno-racial claims about Anglo-European cultural distinctiveness with a self-consciously universal language of the United States as a uniquely free and equal society. They further contended that public schools were failing to adequately teach children in the nation's true values and called for a series of school measures with uncanny resemblances to the present. In exploring this pre-history of today's attacks on public schools, the essay teases out why arguments akin to anti-""CRT"" claims initially emerged and recur whenever there have been major flashpoints around cultural and national identity. It also highlights a seemingly paradoxical phenomenon: In the United States, the most prominent defenses of racial hierarchy and attacks on racial reform often speak in a ""civic"" and ostensibly universal register rather than in an ""ethnic"" nationalist one. This fact requires Americans to confront the embedded drawbacks of longstanding and taken-for-granted narratives of national purpose, narratives commonly invoked across the political spectrum.",2023,9/29/25 19:28,,2,58,Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review,,,,,,Critical race theory; Elementary and Secondary Schools; Legislation; Public schools; United States; World War I

Moreover, even elite athletes with high incomes must find other employment after sports. This justifies the development of their human capital via education valued by employers. Our article originally approaches this issue with recommendations for the effective education of athletes. The aim is to identify and analyze the key skills that former athletes use in the work environment and that help them successfully integrate into employment outside sports. Our robust scientific approach, described in the methodology, combines relevant secondary and primary data and corresponding analytical methods. The secondary data analysis identified the skills required by employers as well as the employment of former athletes in areas outside of sports. Based on quantitative primary data (questionnaire on a sample of 237 young athletes), the skills perceived as important by young athletes were revealed. The qualitative component is represented by interviews with selected former athletes and employers from the corporate environment. The main findings include the alignment of the perceived importance of certain skills by young athletes and employers. The high perceived importance of education during sports careers was supported by all stakeholders.</p>",2/5/25,9/29/25 19:27,46,2,15,,,,,,,

But the stereotypes of the city often identified as ""Charm City"" suffer from a distinct set of initiatives that produce ""Banking Deserts"" in the city's predominantly Black neighborhoods. Inadequate access to financial services leaves a community susceptive to predatory lending institutions which only create a cycle of unethical financial service practices. In addition to the lack of financial services, the absence of banking in Black communities restricts access to capital and the overall financial literacy of its residents. This research explores some of the root causes of the city's racial and social-economic divide through the lens of critical race theory (CRT), as well as analyzes where the city is today. The study looks at historical legislation that caused systematic failure and perpetuated decades of discriminatory practices and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) which was designed to address the access challenge in underserved communities. The decades of social inequities in Charm City, have left a social and economic divide in the city, requiring corrective action and aggressive systematic change.",2021,9/29/25 19:28,,5,23,Public Integrity,,,,,,Baltimore (Md.); Community banks; Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (U.S.); Consumer Lending; Critical race theory; Financial institutions; Predatory lending; Smart cities

We also investigated how student-athletes' gender and individual success expectations, and their parents' reported levels of affection and success expectations, were associated with different burnout trajectories. Student-athletes completed associated questionnaires at the beginning and end of the first school year, while parents completed questionnaires at the end of the school year. Linear mixed models showed that sport and school burnout symptoms increased over the school year. Females reported higher baseline levels of sport burnout, and males lower baseline levels of school burnout. Low individual success expectations were associated with higher baseline levels of sport and school burnout, and increase in school burnout symptoms over time. High parental success expectations were associated with lower baseline levels of school-related exhaustion. Sport inadequacy increased for student-athletes whose parents reported either affection levels and success expectations that were either both high or both low. The results suggest that it is important that sport schools take the dual pressure student-athletes may experience into consideration, and provide them with adequate support during the transition to lower secondary education. In addition, interventions aimed at increasing parental knowledge of beneficial and harmful ways of involvement in student-athletes' lives are needed to facilitate student-athlete wellbeing.",2025,9/29/25 20:24,,,,Psychology of sport and exercise,,,,,<p>Source: Athlete Financial Behavior PubMed</p>; <p>Source: Athlete Financial Behavior PubMed</p>,

We use Critical Race Theory (CRT) to frame the historical context of racism in the U.S. and the emergence of racist ideologies. We examine the extent to which White privilege awareness mediates the relationship between CBRI and antiracist practices among White people. We found that (1) participants' antiracist practices were increased the more they rejected power‐evasive forms of CBRI, (2) people who were more aware of their White privilege were also more driven toward antiracist practices, and (3) respondents' awareness of their White privilege was enhanced as they rejected power evasive forms of CBRI. We also found that White people were more likely to participate in antiracist practices when they rejected power evasion CBRI partly because rejecting CBRI enhanced their awareness of White privilege. Our results suggest that the fight against racism requires White people to acknowledge and dismantle the privileges that come with being a member of a dominant group.

The attacks on and misrepresentations of CRT illustrate whiteness's preferred memory of U.S. history as a rhetorical vehicle for sustaining political, economic, and social power. I offer here an argument for what a preferred memory looks like, how it is constructed, and why. I suggest that popular American movies have overwhelmingly created discourses of race that comfort and sustain whiteness. I use the 2011 film, The Help to show how narratives comfort whiteness and define racism through collective nostalgia and intentional ignorance. I then identify several key strategies whiteness employs to ""insulate itself against refutation"" while reaffirming racism as strictly an interpersonal phenomenon.",2023,9/29/25 19:28,,4,88,Southern Communication Journal,,,,,,"Collective memory; Critical race theory; Help, The (Film); Nostalgia; Power (Social sciences); Racial identity of white people; Racism"

We consider this proposition via an analysis of standard textbooks for undergraduate courses in social psychology. Our review reveals that standard textbooks do not include racism, per se, as a topic of investigation; instead, they tend to consider racism‐relevant topics as specific cases of supposedly more basic (and therefore more general) processes of cognition or affect. We conclude the article by drawing on textbooks from South African settings and perspectives of decolonial theory (i.e., examples of social psychologies Other‐wise) as resources to re‐think hegemonic social psychology in directions that resonate more clearly with a CRT emphasis on the systematicity of racism.",2024,9/29/25 19:28,,2,80,Journal of Social Issues,,,,,,Critical race theory; Eurocentrism; Institutional racism; Other printing; Race discrimination; Racism; Social psychology; Textbooks

They do this by telling lies that inflate the value of free expression/speech and diminish and dismiss the harms that hate speech inflicts on marginalized groups. To move towards honest hate speech laws in both jurisdictions, I propose a communications strategy that seeks to reframe hate speech from a free speech issue to a public health issue.

We show that Republican legislators and conservative media's use of the term ""critical race theory"" dwarfed that of Democratic legislators and liberal media, respectively. A spike in general interest in the term happened concurrently with this elite push. We then hypothesize that in part due to this asymmetry in exposure to the term ""critical race theory"" itself in elite messaging, CRT policy may have an asymmetric effect on political mobilization, favoring Republicans, who tend to oppose the teaching of CRT in schools. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a survey experiment and find that Republicans presented with a pro-CRT policy change are politically mobilized, while Democrats presented with an anti-CRT policy change are not. In particular, Republicans exposed to the pro-CRT policy reported a higher likelihood of voting, encouraging others to vote, and contacting their local politicians.

Drawing on critical race theory (CRT) tenets that racism is ubiquitous and race a social construct, this paper discusses concerns regarding racism in research which have been broadly divided into two categories for critical appraisers to consider: the underrepresentation of minoritised ethnic groups in health studies, especially where minoritised populations see higher rates of disease occurrence and; the utilisation of racial/ethnicity data to interpret disparities in outcomes, including speculation of biological race, the misinterpretation of genetic ancestry as race, and the lack of investigation into social determinants of health, including systemic, institutional and interpersonal forms of racism. The injustices exposed in this paper impact the health of minoritised ethnic groups and are therefore a Black Lives Matter issue. They risk resurrecting dangerous theories regarding biological inferiority among minoritised ethnic populations, as well as hindering study findings. The application of CRT frameworks in health science research quality appraisal is discussed in relation to the above themes – using largely UK-based contexts with supporting examples from the US – followed by recommendations for critically appraising for antiracism.

We conceptualise off-rolling as a hidden process of exclusion in education, and the stories shared in this paper bring into sharp focus the educational, relational and emotional impacts of camouflaged exclusionary practices. We offer four composite stories of exclusion to demonstrate how some of the most vulnerable, excluded, and marginalised young Black people from English urban cities experience further marginalisation because off-rolling, we argue, places learners in a space (both physically and educationally) located beyond care and inclusion. Storytelling is mobilised as a central method in CRT for challenging and exposing exclusionary practices, as it foregrounds the knowledge and lived experience of people of colour and we explore the processes of constructing such counter-stories. As an encouragement to reflection and critical conversation about unlawful exclusion and racial disparities, this paper was written with three goals in mind. The first is that it may inspire educators of colour to tell counter-stories that name their own reality and experiences of exclusion. Second, that in reading and responding to counter-stories, white educators will be encouraged to develop their own racial literacy. Finally, the third goal is that the call to action is answered from within and beyond the confines of academia, where inclusion and racial justice in education can no longer be left to wait.",2022,9/29/25 19:28,,3,27,Emotional & Behavioural Difficulties,,,,,,Black people; Critical race theory; Metropolitan areas; Minorities; Professional employee training; Racism; School discipline; Social justice; Storytelling; United Kingdom

Factors of development that are affecting the quality of post-sport career transition of Olympic athletes are important to acknowledge in the dual career (DC) development perspective. Due to the side lining of academic activities, athletes are often not well prepared for the labor market. If they do not gain sufficient financial background in their careers, it can lead to a lack of proper economic inclusion of athletes in their post-sport career employment and further impact their lives. Career transitions of athletes have been the subject of research in different aspects of DC support (e.g., athletic, psychological, psychosocial, academic/vocational, financial), but most research is linked to the student-athlete DC perspective. Therefore, the aim of our research was to examine the impact of factors directly contributing to the quality of the post-sport career transition in Slovenian elite and Olympic athletes and the social class position and employment of these athletes after the termination of their sports career. From DC support practice, we learned that although athletes often have a proper level of education, their post-sport career transitions were not successful.

While enduring racial stratification produces numerous educational disparities, I argue that these disparities, in turn, contribute to reinforcing the symbolic meanings associated with racial categories. Put simply, racial inequality in education is both a consequence and a cause of race itself. I review these ""predictable"" patterns of racial inequality in education, distilling some of the nuances that are most frequently misunderstood and summarizing trends through recent data. Next, I examine explanations for racial inequality in education, debunking some persistent misconceptions. Then I synthesize the patterns and explanations with literature highlighting how racial inequality in education re‐constructs durable notions of racial categories and racialization. All three of these areas have produced significant scholarship, but they are seldom fully in conversation with one another. Finally, I discuss the role of race and racism in the latest politicization of schools to argue that it can be understood as a new wave in the colorblind era, with significant implications for the social construction of whiteness and the potential to stall progress toward reducing racial inequality in education.",2024,9/29/25 19:28,,3,39,Sociological Forum,,,,,,Critical race theory; Educational equalization; Racial inequality; Racism; Social impact

This study shows an illustrative framework for financial literacy content areas required by professional athletes to achieve long-term financial well-being. Actor–network theory guided the completion of 27 semistructured face-to-face interviews as well as 10 structured follow-up interviews conducted in South Africa among networks of rugby and cricket players to develop and validate the framework. The research findings suggest professional athletes should take responsibility for their financial planning and have the financial literacy skills to seek, interpret, and apply financial advice. The findings also provide some considerations for education initiatives to improve the financial literacy of professional athletes.

We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for ""just-in-time"" financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help.

Our use of CRT allows us to understand heirs property as a legacy of the Jim Crow era and to recognize material motivations behind continued racial discrimination that has led to involuntary land loss. CRT also leads us to consider the question of empowerment of the Gullah/Geechee population through a program of reparations for wrongful taking of land and homes since coastal development began roughly 70 years ago.

The reason is the almost absolute absence of financial or material support for such early-career athletes, when their transition from junior categories and the entire junior category is almost always exclusively financed and supported by their parents and families. We also emphasise the absolute absence of legislative provisions that would give supporters of such athletes at least a tax or other advantage. The research is based on research of Cardenas (2023), Hong and Fraser (2023) and Moolman and Shuttleworth (2023) and aims to assess how financial and material support provided by sponsors can enhance an athlete’s performance and long-term career trajectory. A mixed method approach was adopted, combining quantitative analysis through surveys and performance data with qualitative interviews. Data from 173 early career athletes from various disciplines were analysed using t-tests and ANOVA statistical methods to assess financial stability, access to better training, and community participation. Results indicate that sponsorship significantly contributes to better performance metrics, with sponsored athletes showing a 20% improvement in competition results compared to nonsponsored athletes. Furthermore, sponsorship financial support improved training opportunities and access to elite facilities, which was shown to increase athletes’ performance by 15%. However, some challenges related to sponsorship obligations, such as marketing commitments, were highlighted by athletes, underscoring the pressures that sponsorship can introduce. The implications of this study suggest that effective sponsorship strategies can play a vital role in an athlete’s career development, offering not only financial stability but also opportunities for personal branding and increased community engagement. Another implication is a possible consideration for legislators in the context of preparing a legislative framework enabling tax or other benefits for companies and organisations sponsoring or supporting these young athletes. More research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of sponsorship on athlete mental health and career sustainability, as well as the differences in sponsorship effects across various sports disciplines.",2024,9/29/25 19:28,,12,8,,,,,,,athlete performance; brand visibility; financial investment; image building; interviews; qualitative data; sports sponsorship; team performance

Narratives are especially salient in politics, as policy problems do not simply exist, but are actively created through the stories policy actors tell. Scholars introduced the narrative policy framework (NPF) to create a generalized framework for studying how policy actors use storytelling strategically to influence policy. We use the NPF to examine the recent rise of critical race theory (CRT) in policy debates. We demonstrate that increasing exposure to the ban‐CRT narrative plots led to greater support for a ban on CRT, particularly for White and Republican individuals. Finally, we introduce and test the concept of narrative spillover, which provides a new way of thinking about how micro, meso, and macro policy narratives interact to influence‐related political beliefs and macrolevel beliefs about institutions and culture.",2024,9/29/25 19:28,,2,52,Policy Studies Journal,,,,,,Critical analysis; Critical race theory; Policy analysis; Story plots

Researchers can use Critical Race Theory (CRT) to do so. However, scholars within the field of psychology may confront growing pains when integrating psychology research with CRT due to their respective inquiry worldviews—postpositivism and critical—which result in several tensions pertaining to the framing of research and methods. These tensions may limit the uptake of CRT in psychology and may cause people to struggle to understand CRT. Therefore in this article, we describe (a) CRT and related frameworks, (b) tensions when integrating CRT into psychology, and (c) strategies to attenuate the tensions. Additionally, we highlight the importance of identity and the political choice of using CRT. It is critical for psychology researchers to challenge dominant postpositivist research inquiry worldviews and deconstruct what is considered ""legitimate knowledge."" By doing so, we can (a) validate experiences and vast forms of knowledge that shape the reality of People of Color and our families, communities, and cultures and (b) challenge systems of oppression.",2024,9/29/25 19:28,,1,80,Journal of Social Issues,,,,,,Critical race theory; Educational psychology; Educational Support Services; Identity (Psychology); Racism in psychology; Social justice; Social psychology

Background Despite increasing diversity in doctoral programs, racial and ethnic disparities persist in career outcomes. This paper examines how racial identities and systemic inequalities influence the career aspirations and decisions of doctoral students, highlighting the need for race-conscious dialogue in career development. Methodology A narrative literature review was conducted, focusing on peer-reviewed articles published between 2013 and 2023. The analysis utilized CRT to identify and examine themes related to race and career choices among doctoral students. A total of 23 articles were reviewed to assess the influence of race on career decision-making processes. Contribution This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by applying CRT to understand the career choices of doctoral students, a perspective that has been underutilized in this context. By integrating a race-conscious lens, this approach builds on existing literature and challenges dominant narratives in doctoral education, emphasizing the critical role of race and systemic factors in shaping career pathways. Findings The review identifies three major themes: (1) the endemic nature of racism in career choices, (2) the role of counter-storytelling in the career aspirations of students of color, and (3) the intersectionality of race with other identities influencing career decisions. These findings reveal how systemic racism and personal narratives intersect to impact the career trajectories of doctoral students, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds. Recommendations for Practitioners Universities should recognize and address the role of race in career choices by fostering inclusive environments, providing culturally responsive mentoring, and validating diverse career paths beyond academia. Enhanced support for students from underrepresented groups is essential to mitigate systemic barriers. Recommendations for Researchers Future research should continue to explore the intersectionality of race, gender, and class in doctoral students' career decisions. Qualitative studies focusing on the experiential knowledge of underrepresented students and examining alternative career pathways outside academia are particularly needed. Impact on Society Understanding the racial dynamics in doctoral education can lead to more equitable career opportunities and contribute to diversifying the nation's intellectual and professional workforce. This paper underscores the importance of addressing systemic racism to create inclusive academic and professional environments. Future Research Further studies should investigate the structural and institutional factors that shape career pathways for doctoral students, with a focus on how academic and racial biases influence career choices. Expanding the scope to include international doctoral students and their unique challenges in career decision-making is also recommended.",2024,9/29/25 19:28,,,19,International Journal of Doctoral Studies,,,,,,Career development; Critical race theory; Doctoral students; Institutional racism; Mentoring; Professional and Management Development Training; Vocational guidance; Vocational Rehabilitation Services

Here, we study the problem of how to optimally allocate limited sampling time to multiple options, modeled as accumulators of noisy evidence, to determine the most profitable one. We show that the effective sampling capacity of an agent increases with both available time and the discriminability of the options, and optimal policies undergo a sharp transition as a function of it. For small capacity, it is best to allocate time evenly to exactly five options and to ignore all the others, regardless of the prior distribution of rewards. For large capacities, the optimal number of sampled accumulators grows sublinearly, closely following a power law as a function of capacity for a wide variety of priors.

Desk-based data collection was applied to 23 sporting organisations; these comprised 21 national organisations representing 19 coun-tries, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Oceanic National Olympic Committee (ONOC). Fifteen of the 23 organisations, representing 14 countries, provided some support or interventions on financial planning and self-management within their career assistance programmes. The findings also indicate that most organisations in 17 different countries did not provide any financial support for athletes’ retirements. While a number of sport organisations have developed appropriate interventions to assist high-performance athletes to develop financial literacy and self-management skills, such schemes appear only to be provided to high-performance athletes who have competed at the highest level e.g., Olympics, world championships, etc. Support for athletes at lower levels should also be developed and delivered by national governments, or by national sport organisations.",1/1/22,9/29/25 19:27,,1,15,,,,,,,career development and self-management; career transitions in sport; financial literacy; financial well-being; organisational support

Methods: We utilized a mixed-methods approach, grounded in Critical Race Theory (CRT). This study included an analysis of state policies' components and mechanisms to consider whether they are grounded in racially unjust assumptions. The critical policy analysis is combined with a QuantCrit analysis of national data from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) to understand how identified aspects of the policies would affect students of differing races/ethnicities. Results: Our critical policy discourse analysis demonstrates that states' transfer incentive policies could foster racial inequity through the requirements students must meet (e.g., full-time status, being under the age of 24) and assumptions about what students may know or need regarding transfer. The QuantCrit analysis revealed that many transfer incentive requirements from the policy analysis findings would have a disproportionately negative effect on racially minoritized students' transfer eligibility. Together, findings and results illustrate how transfer incentives can contribute to educational inequity for racially minoritized students via color-evasive and meritocratic policies. Conclusions/Contributions: Implications include policy reform needed for the development of incentives aligned with closing the racial transfer gap and focused on incentivizing 2- and 4-year institutions in improving the transfer rates of racially minoritized students.",2023,9/29/25 19:28,,1,51,Community College Review,,,,,,Critical discourse analysis; Critical race theory; Ethnicity; Monetary incentives; Race; Racial inequality; Transfer students

CRT has become a principal target for erasure in a raging political campaign that seeks to suppress discussions about racial and gender justice. It does so, in part, by using law to compel the miseducation of the American populace, including its children. The campaign suggests, in the case of race, that efforts to promote racial justice, combat racism, and employ race as an analytical lens--antiracism--is racist. That is, the rightwing argument has shifted from the colorblind assertion that race is irrelevant, to one in which consideration of race is illegitimate. It is not simply illegitimate because it is irrelevant, but because, incredulously, it is racist and racism no longer exists in America, if it ever did. I argue this miseducation campaign arose to divert attention from the demands for a racial reckoning triggered by the police murder of Mr. George Floyd. This reckoning portended consolidation of a multiracial, multiethnic democratic majority and progress in racial justice, among other changes; changes apparently perceived as threatening to the privileged status of whiteness in the United States' racial hierarchy. As such, I contend, the campaign's goals are not merely to silence the voices of those seeking justice and therefore change that includes fuller and truer accounts of American history. Rather, it seeks to control, or if necessary, destroy, the educational and other institutions that house justice voices and to remove the people representing these voices from participation in institutions and other public spaces. I note that the campaign also supports and facilitates efforts to privatize education. In other words, in contextualizing the campaign, I suggest that it is part of a broader, larger, and multifaceted antidemocratic backlash movement that reactionary forces are advancing to limit access to voting, education, healthcare, and processes that might protect the economic interests of people of color, poor people, nonbinary people, and women, among others. In short, this broader movement seeks to undermine democracy and re-impose--dare I say--elite white male minority rule. The conservative majority on the Supreme Court, I suggest, is facilitating this effort.",2023,9/29/25 19:28,,3,100,Denver Law Review,,,,,,Critical race theory; Justice; Political campaigns; Race; Racial identity of white people

PCRT illustrates the integral connection of psychological research and theory to the legal framework of Critical Race Theory (CRT). Five tenets of PCRT were described: (1) Spontaneous and persistent influence of race; (2) Fairness is derived from divergent racial experiences; (3) Asymmetrical consequences of racial policies; (4) Paradoxes of racial diversity; and (5) Racial identity requires a multidimensional approach. These tenets are reviewed and updated. A new set of seven PCRT principles are proposed that provide a broad framework within which to examine the PCRT concept and its role in reframing critical approaches to racial justice. Principle 1: Race and culture make each other up; Principle 2: Meaning Matters; Principle 3: Multilevel analysis is critical to unraveling Systemic Racism; Principle 4: Activism is a lever for social change; Principle 5: Power drives racial inequality; Principle 6: Storytelling disrupts status quo narratives; Principle 7: Diversity does not ameliorate systemic racism. PCRT is a 100‐year enterprise of psychological science, offering a complex and comprehensive framework for understanding and ameliorating persistent racial inequality.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to redefine how individuals plan, invest, and manage their finances. According to a study by PwC, assets managed by AI-enabled digital platforms will surge from 2.5 trillion USD in 2022 to nearly 6 trillion USD in 2027. This shift promises to make personalized financial planning more accessible, efficient, and effective than ever before. In this blog, we will explore how AI is revolutionizing wealth management by optimizing investment strategies and discover how these advancements can lead to more informed and secure financial decisions. The current landscape Traditional wealth management has long been the domain of financial advisors who rely on their expertise and experience to guide clients. While this approach has its merits, it also has limitations: Human bias and error: Human biases and errors are inherent in wealth management, often leading to sub-optimal financial decisions.

As teachers, administrators, and civil rights organizations scramble to interpret these bills, many wonder: How can this be constitutional? At the heart of this broader question is a legal problem that remains unaddressed by both scholars and the Supreme Court: Is K-12 teacher speech, particularly instructional speech, protected under the First Amendment? This Note seeks to fill this gap in legal scholarship and jurisprudence, using anti-CRT laws as a lens through which to evaluate the constitutional protections afforded to K-12 teacher speech. Part I of this Note provides a qualitative survey of anti-CRT laws, unpacking the speech and activity that the laws restrict. Part II reviews the major doctrinal approaches available to courts for analyzing K-12 teacher speech. Part III analyzes how those existing doctrinal approaches apply to anti-CRT laws, concluding that existing doctrine is inadequate for the task. Education law and policy operate under the implicit assumption that the government may regulate the ""what"" of teaching by setting curriculum, but the ""how"" of teaching is largely left up to teachers as certified professionals. Anti-CRT laws, however, represent a sharp departure from that approach. In making that departure, they impermissibly infringe on K-12 teachers' First Amendment rights. This Note argues that courts can remedy this problem by making the implicit doctrinal distinction between the ""what"" and the ""how"" of teaching explicit and striking down anti-CRT laws as unconstitutional in violation of the First Amendment.",2023,9/29/25 19:28,,1,75,Stanford Law Review,,,,,,Critical race theory; Racism; Sexism; Teaching; United States.

Resolute in the effort to destabilize American Democracy by forcing on to the populist, among other messages, “The Big Lie,” the rightwing is committed to a coordinated strategy of attacking and delegitimizing democratic institutions for the purpose of retaining economic and political power. The attack on Critical Race Theory (“CRT”) is one element of the strategy to assault liberal democracy that has caught fire. Though CRT is in the crosshairs, higher education institutions represent the larger target, because they are the places and spaces where critical thinking, public discourse, and reasoned debate are practiced in furtherance of liberal, democratic ideals. Thus, the targeting of CRT is intended to chill specific speech representing various perspectives and viewpoints that critique the dominant white hierarchy. The objective of the rightwing assault is to propagate unreality, division, and fear to thwart the outcomes of a liberal democracy—equality, multiculturalism, and intellectualism. The attacks on CRT are only one in a salvo of new and growing incursions on conveying truth in educational spaces. The intention is to whitewash America’s history of racism and racial oppression, while at the same time eliminating the critical roles that dissent and contestation play in strengthening the “democratic health of [American] society.” The unjustified barrage on CRT is a pretext for the erosion of freedom of thought and inquiry in our higher education institutions. Higher education institutions have the resources to archive truth, intellectual inquiry, dissent, and contestation and, therefore, must be out front in the battle for the hearts and minds of the next generation of critical thinkers. This Essay discusses one approach for understanding the scope of CRT, explains why attacks on CRT are undemocratic, and concludes by suggesting how higher education institutions should respond to the attacks on CRT.",2022,9/29/25 19:28,,4,66,St. Louis University Law Journal,,,,,,Critical race theory; Higher education; Liberalism; Multiculturalism; Racism

Athletes who receive stable financial backing have better access to training, recovery, and mental health resources, allowing them to focus on their athletic development.

Emerging models, such as fan-funded platforms and blockchain solutions, offer promising alternatives to traditional sponsorships, suggesting a more equitable future for athlete funding. The review concludes that while financial support is indispensable for athletes, the current system is marked by inequities.

Qualitative methodology allows researchers to advance and apply their interpersonal and subjectivity skills to their research exploratory processes.

Furthermore, as a qualitative research approach, IPA gives researchers the best opportunity to understand the innermost deliberation of the ‘lived experiences’ of research participants. As an approach that is ‘participant-oriented’, interpretative phenomenological analysis approach allows the interviewees (research participants) to express themselves and their ‘lived experience’ stories the way they see fit without any distortion and/or prosecution. Therefore, utilizing the IPA approach in a qualitative research study reiterates the fact that its main objective and essence are to explore the ‘lived experiences’ of the research participants and allow them to narrate the research findings through their ‘lived experiences’. As such, this paper discusses the historical background of phenomenology as both a theory and a qualitative research approach, an approach that has transitioned into an interpretative analytical tradition.

CRT as an analytical lens allows scholars to show how policy can uphold the status quo while reinforcing whiteness in society. Anti-CRT legislation has centered on the idea of CRT as divisive, which led to our intentional focus of this study on the initial creation of these policies to analyze the arguments as linked to sociopolitical rhetoric. To this aim, we critically examined the rationales across 42 states and a total of 66 documents using a CRT framework, particularly whiteness as property. We employed the sociocognitive approach to critical discourse analysis (CDA) to reveal how power and racism are reproduced in legal logic, pointing to the relationship between discourse, cognition, and society. Our findings indicate the ways that policymakers invoked race neutrality through emotionality and sought curricular control through dominant norms such as impartiality, objectivity, and historical accuracy. We provide a significant contribution to the body of scholarship on legislative attacks in higher education by focusing on racism and white emotionality, which is reinforced in policy discourse and connected to current political resistance to change.",2025,9/29/25 19:28,,,,Journal of Higher Education,,,,,,Critical discourse analysis; Critical race theory; Cultural hegemony; Curriculum; Ideology; Legal reasoning; Racism; Rhetoric & politics

Critical Race Theory and MacKinnon both seek to unmask the seemingly neutral subject which authorizes law as in reality a hegemonic and oppressive subject. They also employ the tools of liberalism, demanding justice and equal protection under the law. I argue that the apparent contradiction of their demands can be understood by seeing the subject itself as combining these contradictions at the level of the relation between the unconscious and consciousness. The ego strives for rational self‐organization while the unconscious contains sedimented socially transmitted prejudice. There is thus room within both for the struggle for freedom and justice espoused by liberalism at the conscious level as well as for the unconscious perpetuation of prejudice and domination. I conclude that MacKinnon's work and that of CRT show that liberalism must not be abandoned as post‐structuralism does, but that liberals is in fact aided by its critics.",2020,9/29/25 19:28,,4,51,Philosophical Forum,,,,,,"Critical race theory; Liberalism; MacKinnon, Catharine; Poststructuralism; Prejudices"

The bills seek to prohibit the teaching of ideas that include the premise that racism and sexism are pervasive in our society. Those opposing CRT believe its tenets promote anti-white racism, cultural division, and threaten the public institution of education. Scholars and educators have criticized anti-CRT bills for their mischaracterization of the use and tenets of CRT and related theories of scholarship. This Article argues that state anti-CRT laws and policies in higher education run afoul of legal and normative principles. First, the bans conflict with basic First Amendment legal standards. Second, the bans are poor policy choices because they run contrary to the pursuit of equity and inclusion in educational environments as well as the traditional norms of higher education. Part I of the Article provides an overview of recent efforts to ban CRT and their relation to higher education.

The least mature players and relatively young players may have a greater need to possess superior technical/tactical or psycho-behavioral skills than those relatively older counterparts because of the higher selection rates of early maturing players. Due to RAEs, a significant decrease in the overall quality of professional soccer teams might be observed because of the loss of talent of physically smaller, but psychologically stronger and more versatile relatively young players who possess proper technical and tactical attributes at an early age.

They faced substantial psychological demands and employed varied coping strategies, navigating pressures, emotional strain, and demonstrating resilience. Participants also had to negotiate life beyond sport, balancing challenging academic responsibilities and social pressures alongside intensive training schedules. Lastly, the YOG served either as a bridge toward sustained elite progression or as a turning point, often leading to burnout and early disengagement.

Critical Race Mixed Methodology (CRMM) is a type of critical mixed methods research that combines Critical Race Theory (CRT) and mixed methods research (DeCuir-Gunby in Educational Psychologist 55, 244-255, 2020). However, there are limited examples of CRMM within higher education research (Johnson & Strayhorn in Journal of Diversity in Higher Education 16, 539-553, 2023). Our study further operationalizes CRMM through the explication of an explanatory sequential mixed methods exploration of African American college students' experiences with racial microaggressions, where the qualitative findings are used to expand upon the quantitative findings (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2017). The study uses Critical Race Theory (Bell, 1992; Ladson-Billings & Tate in Teachers College Record 97, 47-68, 1995; Solórzano & Huber, 2020) to focus on how African American college students' experiencing of racial microaggressions influences their racial identity and feelings of belonging in historically white institutions (HWIs). The quantitative findings (n = 97) indicated that private regard (racial identity) protected students' sense of belonging when experiencing racial microaggressions. The qualitative findings (n = 15) explored students' stories regarding their experiences with racial microaggressions, focusing on their feelings of belonging. Through our discussion, we advance the use of mixed methods in higher education research to better understand the racialized experiences of African American college students and demonstrate how CRMM can be used to integrate quantitative and qualitative findings.",2024,9/29/25 19:28,,6,49,Innovative Higher Education,,,,,,Critical race theory; Higher education; Mixed methods research; Race identity; Social justice

This was compounded by another deadly pandemic that was devastating Black communities and evidenced by the re-emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd. Parallels can be drawn between the deadly COVID-19 virus and the anti-Black systemic racism fuelling the existence of the Black Lives Matter movement – which both disproportionately kill Black people. Therefore, many within these communities are living in a ""pandemic within a pandemic"". Still, the focus on Black boys and men continued the parallels between both pandemics, failing to include the plight of Black girls and women who are also enduring the same impact as their Black male counterparts. This paper draws upon previous doctoral research about the educational journeys and experiences of Black British women graduates in light of the educational implications of the ""pandemic within a pandemic"" for this group. Framed by Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Bourdieu's Theory of Practice (BTP) within the context of Black Feminist Epistemology (BFE), it highlights that Black women and girls have to bear an unfair ""burden of care"" not only for themselves but for others too. Lastly, it will argue that now more than ever, due to the ""pandemic within a pandemic"", as a society we all need to be checkin' for Black girls and women as they have been silently suffering, navigating and overcoming for far too long.",2022,9/29/25 19:28,,3,74,Educational Review,,,,,,Black Lives Matter movement; Black women; COVID-19 pandemic; Racism in education; United States

The research design thus leans on King and Chandler's (2016) distinction between non-racist and antiracist stances, as well as Andreotti et al'.s (2015) social cartography that maps out 'soft-reform' and 'radical reform' spaces, to achieve a latent content analysis of 14 pieces of legislation across 13 states since 2020 to identify and analyse the ideological characteristics of these pieces of legislation. Only four of the 14 documents from four different states contain a significant anti-racist ideological leaning; the others express a liberal multicultural ideological position that celebrates difference and recognizes contributions, but does not examine systemic racism. Thus, among states that are legislating more ethnic studies, the vast majority do not legislate anti-racist positions.

Given the billions of dollars generated by college sports, this limitation has been seen as unfair, leading some college athletes to explore ways to obtain a portion of profits as compensation. Over the past decade, this restriction on student-athlete financial gain has been loosened through a number of court cases. In 2021, the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), the governing body of college athletics that sets rules and protocols for college sports, changed their policies to allow student athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through endorsements, sale of merchandise, appearances, and other profitable activities. Given the newness of NIL policy, little is known about its impact on college athletes or college athletics. As a first step in exploring this topic, this study examined the characteristics of student athletes with very high NIL valuation to see who is benefiting the most from this change in policy. Using a listing of the athletes with the top 100 NIL valuation as of September 2023, it was shown that the valuation of top NIL athletes ranged from US$497,000 to US$6.1 million, with a median value of US$734,000. These top 100 athletes were predominantly football (76%) and basketball (22%) players, predominantly Black (68%) and overwhelmingly male (94%). Using negative binomial regression, it was found that the athlete's number of Instagram followers was significantly associated with NIL valuation, thus athletes with activity and skills in social media were shown to benefit greatly from the new NIL policies. Implications of these findings and next steps needed in NIL research are discussed.",12/1/24,9/29/25 19:27,33-48,4,15,,,,,,,Amateurism; College Sports; Name Image and Likeness; NIL; Student Athlete

To address this major gap, this Article argues that there is an opportunity for learning, sharing, and collaboration between Critical Race Theorists (CRT) and scholars of Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL). Such a collaboration, this Article argues, would produce a very sharp lens of tracing issues of race and identity in the imperial, transnational, and global histories of international law and their contemporary continuities. By adopting a framework of studying race and identity in a global context, this Article will tie together and connect the domestic and the international. It will connect transnational histories between locations inside and outside the United States that have undergirded and reinforced White supremacism, as well as anticolonial resistance, domestically and internationally. Taking such an approach overcomes the wide variety of segregated and insular conceptualizations and definitions of race and identity within CRT and TWAIL respectively. Building a TWAIL/CRT global/transnational race/histories project will create productive insights about ideologies of racial domination and racial injustices in a domestic, international, and transnational context. By combining the insights of CRT and TWAIL, it becomes possible to theorize imperialism and racism beyond those currently embodied in each approach.",2021,9/29/25 19:28,,6,67,UCLA Law Review,,,,,,Critical race theory; International law; Race; Racism; United States; White supremacy

This article leans into fugivity and critical race theory (CRT) to demonstrate how hip-hop music can be a capacious avenue for theorizing alternate ways to disrupt hegemonic, oppressive, and racist educational structures and master narratives. In particular, we use two Wu-Tang tracks (e.g. ""Can it be all so simple,"" ""Triumph"") to demonstrate how static approaches to hip-hop—specifically the Wu-Tang—reduce and flatten engagements with hip-hop music in educational contexts. Central to our argument is that the aesthetics of the Wu-Tang Clan are more than economically damaged narratives that tether various culture entities together: Wu-Tang is theory.",2023,9/29/25 19:28,,3,56,Equity & Excellence in Education,,,,,,Aesthetics; Critical race theory; Praxis (Process); Rap music; Swarm intelligence; Wu Tang Clan (Performer)

Bradley played field hockey for the university, and in September 2011, she was hit on the head during a field hockey game between the university and Richmond University. After that hit, she began experiencing symptoms of a concussion, but continued to play hockey in practice and games. The plaintiff was not advised to sit out of practices and games, despite her symptoms persisting and a diagnosis of a concussion being confirmed. The plaintiff claimed the injury caused harm to her physical, emotional, and mental state. Paying monetary damages and the staff failing to appropriately treat her condition led to this situation. The plaintiff filed actions against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the Patriot League, the University, the Medicine Center, David L. Higgins, and Aaron Williams.

V8PSXVT9,report,2024,Broadridge,How different approaches to AI will shape the future of Wealth Management,,,,broadridge.com/ai-in-wealth,"Questions about AI? Let's connect It took seven years for the internet to reach 100 million users. It took ChatGPT just 60 days. Over the course of the two years since that milestone achievement, the wealth management industry has emerged as a proving ground for the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform client engagement, reinvent proprietary research, and redefine business models. The phenomenon has also stirred a great deal of speculation about the pace of AI adoption among firms and what it means for the future of the industry. AI adoption by-the-numbers Broadridge recently put a spotlight on this uneven approach to AI with the findings of our fourth annual Digital Transformation Study, which found that even though 72% of firms are prioritizing investments in AI, there is a wide gap emerging between those that are leading the way on AI adoption and those that have yet to take the plunge. In fact, we found that 51% of firms characterized as digital leaders are already investing in AI while just 22% of non-leaders are investing in AI. Beyond the numbers: the real-world perspective As we've continued to dig deeper into the findings, talk with clients, and evaluate our own experiences, the gap between leaders and non-leaders on overall AI investment is just part of the story. The real insight is in how different firms are using the technology, the kinds of business cases they are developing to support future investment, and how they are rolling it out across their organizations. Those details are increasingly influencing high-level business strategy for firms that are leading the way on AI adoption and helping to create a roadmap.",,9/29/25 19:28,,,,,,,,,,
