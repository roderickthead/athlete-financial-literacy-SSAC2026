## Conclusion

This implementation framework provides a roadmap for developing evidence-based financial literacy programs for athlete populations. While the current evidence base is limited, consistent themes across studies support specific program components and delivery approaches. The framework emphasizes the need for rigorous evaluation and continuous improvement as programs are implemented and scaled.

Success will require sustained commitment from athletic organizations, adequate funding, qualified instructors, and systematic evaluation. Most importantly, programs must be specifically designed for athlete populations rather than adapted from general financial education curricula. The unique financial challenges and cultural context of athletic careers demand specialized approaches supported by robust research evidence.

The ultimate goal is to improve the long-term financial well-being of athlete populations through evidence-based education that addresses their specific needs and circumstances. This framework provides the foundation for achieving that goal while building the research base necessary for continuous improvement and expansion.
