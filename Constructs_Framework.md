# Constructs Framework

This document outlines the five key constructs that frame the study. Each construct is defined and analyzed according to MacKenzie et al. (2011) guidelines for construct clarity and rigor.

## 1. Financial Literacy  

**Definition**  
Financial literacy is the knowledge and ability to effectively manage personal finances, including budgeting, saving, investing, and planning for long-term wealth stability. In the athlete context, it reflects not only individual skills but also the capacity to navigate structurally complex and often predatory financial environments.  

**Conceptual Domain**  
- Entity: Individual athlete  
- Property: Cognitive and applied knowledge of financial decision-making across the career lifecycle  

**Conceptual Theme**  
- Common: Budgeting, credit management, investing, saving  
- Unique: Compressed earning windows, family remittances, institutional neglect  
- Breadth: Spans both short-term survival skills and long-term intergenerational planning  

**Dimensionality**  
Multidimensional — combines knowledge, applied behaviors, and environmental adaptability.  

**Stability**  
- Over time: Evolves with athlete career stages (collegiate, professional, retirement)  
- Across situations: Varies by context of income (salary, NIL, endorsements)  
- Across cases: Different cultural and educational backgrounds shape trajectories.  

**Use in Prior Research**  
Lusardi & Mitchell (2017) emphasize financial literacy as critical to household stability. Fernandes et al. (2014) highlight its predictive role in financial outcomes. Athlete-focused studies (Stokowski et al., 2021) show fragmented delivery models, while Beamon & Bell (2011) note structural neglect.

## 2. Estate Planning and Wealth Continuity  

**Definition**  
Estate planning is the strategic management of assets, including wealth transfer, tax compliance, and legacy design, to ensure intergenerational continuity.  

**Conceptual Domain**  
- Entity: Athlete and their family/beneficiaries  
- Property: Institutional and advisory frameworks supporting wealth sustainability  

**Conceptual Theme**  
- Common: Wills, trusts, tax strategies, inheritance planning  
- Unique: Athlete-specific vulnerabilities (sudden wealth, predatory advisors)  
- Breadth: Immediate protections + legacy/continuity planning  

**Dimensionality**  
Multidimensional — combines legal, financial, and familial governance.  

**Stability**  
- Over time: Most effective when engaged early and sustained throughout career  
- Across situations: Varies by legal jurisdiction, cultural expectations  
- Across cases: Strong disparities by race, access to advisors, and institutional resources  

**Use in Prior Research**  
Rosplock (2020) frames estate planning in family office contexts. Brotman (2021) highlights risks of neglect among high-earning athletes. Singer (2008) emphasizes disparities for Black athletes.

## 3. Holistic Athlete Development  

**Definition**  
Holistic athlete development refers to integrative support systems that nurture athletes’ academic, financial, social, and personal growth beyond short-term athletic performance.  

**Conceptual Domain**  
- Entity: Athlete  
- Property: Comprehensive well-being and preparedness for life beyond sport  

**Conceptual Theme**  
- Common: Academic support, career services, wellness programs  
- Unique: Intersection of financial literacy and athlete identity development  
- Breadth: Extends from physical training to life and career sustainability  

**Dimensionality**  
Multidimensional — combines education, financial skills, social integration, and well-being.  

**Stability**  
- Over time: Changes across development stages (youth, collegiate, professional)  
- Across situations: Institutional commitment differs widely  
- Across cases: Highly variable depending on sport, gender, and institution  

**Use in Prior Research**  
Comeaux & Harrison (2011) provide academic success models. Beamon (2014) critiques neglect of athlete well-being. Hawkins (2013) argues for athlete-centered development ecosystems.

## 4. Community and Cultural Capital  

**Definition**  
Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) is the set of cultural assets (aspirational, navigational, social, familial, linguistic, and resistant capital) that communities of color draw upon to survive and thrive in oppressive environments (Yosso, 2005).  

**Conceptual Domain**  
- Entity: Athlete (particularly from marginalized communities)  
- Property: Cultural and social assets shaping financial and life decisions  

**Conceptual Theme**  
- Common: Family influence, community ties, resilience  
- Unique: Navigational strategies in racialized and inequitable systems  
- Breadth: Expands the notion of wealth beyond financial metrics  

**Dimensionality**  
Multidimensional — spans cultural, social, and symbolic resources.  

**Stability**  
- Over time: Enduring but expressed differently across life stages  
- Across situations: Contextual application (college vs. pro, supportive vs. predatory systems)  
- Across cases: Stronger in collectivist cultures and communities of color  

**Use in Prior Research**  
Yosso (2005) established CCW as a CRT framework. Cooper et al. (2019) show its role in athlete activism. Singer (2008) emphasizes cultural and structural neglect in athlete development.

## 5. Behavioral Economics  

**Definition**  
Behavioral economics explains financial decisions through bounded rationality, heuristics, and biases, highlighting deviations from purely rational models of decision-making.  

**Conceptual Domain**  
- Entity: Athlete  
- Property: Cognitive and behavioral patterns in decision-making  

**Conceptual Theme**  
- Common: Heuristics, present bias, mental accounting  
- Unique: Stress-induced shortcuts under high-performance pressure  
- Breadth: Explains variance in choices across athletes and contexts  

**Dimensionality**  
Multidimensional — incorporates psychological, cognitive, and contextual factors.  

**Stability**  
- Over time: Shifts with career stage and financial literacy growth  
- Across situations: Triggered under uncertainty, pressure, or unfamiliar contexts  
- Across cases: Strong cultural variation in how heuristics are expressed  

**Use in Prior Research**  
Thaler & Sunstein (2021) establish behavioral nudges. Fernandes et al. (2014) link biases to downstream financial behavior. Patel et al. (2020) explore athlete-specific decision contexts.
